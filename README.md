Mapthy app.
Mapthy app is the web application dedicated to tracking your outdoor activity. Whether you are running or cycling, your training data will be saved.
Once you are done with your training, you can just enter the starting point of your route, how many kilometres you have passed and the minutes it took you to complete the training. Your average speed will be calculated based on the information.
Like this, you can keep a diary of your outdoor training activities.
